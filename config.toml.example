# Copy to config.toml and customize, or run: keyvox --setup

[model]
# Backend: "auto" (detect best), "faster-whisper" (NVIDIA only), "qwen-asr" (universal)
backend = "auto"
# Model name depends on backend:
#   faster-whisper: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3, large-v3-turbo
#   qwen-asr: Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B, Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B
name = "large-v3-turbo"
# Device: cuda or cpu
device = "cuda"
# Compute type:
#   faster-whisper: float16 (GPU), int8 (CPU), float32
#   qwen-asr: bfloat16 (recommended), float16, float32
compute_type = "float16"

[audio]
# Microphone: "default" or device index (run keyvox --setup to list)
input_device = "default"
# Sample rate in Hz
sample_rate = 16000

[hotkey]
# Push-to-talk key: ctrl_r, ctrl_l, alt_r, alt_l, shift_r, etc.

[paths]

[output]
# Auto-paste transcription into active window
auto_paste = true

# Paste method: how to insert transcribed text
# - "type": Simulate typing (NO clipboard interaction, recommended)
#   → Clean: your clipboard stays untouched
#   → Works in 95%+ of apps (browsers, editors, Slack, Discord, etc.)
#   → May not work in some games or admin-level secure inputs
#
# - "clipboard": Paste via Ctrl+V (uses clipboard, simple)
#   → Text goes to clipboard, then pasted
#   → Your clipboard will fill with transcriptions
#   → Works everywhere Ctrl+V works
#
# - "clipboard-restore": Paste via Ctrl+V, then restore old clipboard
#   → Text briefly uses clipboard, then restores previous content
#   → Clipboard managers will log both the transcription AND restored value (creates duplicates)
#   → Use if "type" doesn't work in specific apps
paste_method = "type"
